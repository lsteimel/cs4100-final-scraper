      "textContent": "A few things to note:\n\n1. Due to the single-sequencer setup of rollups today, transactions are instantly confirmed and speculatively finalised on rollup block inclusion. There are no other block producers required to validate/confirm.\n\n2. Hard finality(Stage 3 finality) should only be considered after the dispute period has passed, if no L1 rollbacks have occured prior to it i.e. finality stages 1 and 2. https://twitter.com/thepizzaknight_/status/1642584626366410752?s=46&t=GxyN7qBovxAqEoJW-dTZ8Q\n\n3. The withdrawal of funds process does affect the L2 state and has its respective transaction lifecycle, usually overseen by dedicated opcodes and precompiles.",

      "textContent": "1) It's not instant, but it's quite fast - OP can take up to 2 seconds to confirm a txn. Other systems may allow for some MEV backrunning as well which adds further latency.\n\n2) Again, the dispute period does not affect L2 state. Withdrawals are a way of convincing the L1 of the current L2 state, there is no way for a dispute to change L2 state.\n\n@rauljordaneth made a great post on this yesterday: https://twitter.com/rauljordaneth/status/1703864326665241021.\n\nThe arbitrum docs further go into finality at each step: https://docs.arbitrum.io/tx-lifecycle - \"nothing that can happen in phase 4 has any effect on the L1-level finality we've already locked in at phase 3\".\n\nI also recommend watching this talk from @kelvinfichter: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKQz9jU0ftg.\n\n3) What precompiles/opcodes are you referring to?",
